However, a git clone --bare only copies the history, allowing for a quicker transfer to a new remote repository.\nAdditionally, you can create a non-bare repository from a bare repository. In most cases, when pushing, the new repository should be non-bare．\nThe mirroring process is conducted through communication between the local and the new remote repository, so the old remote repository does not receive any notifications or updates of the new repository."
