By not keeping up with main, you risk your branch passing tests locally but failing in CI/CD because it lacks compatibility with newer changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüçµ Might Be Okay to Ignore main Changes\n\n\n\nThere are situations where you can safely ignore main temporarily:\n\nIsolated feature\nShort-lived feature branch\nExperimental branches\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is no one-size-fits-all approach and it all comes down to what you value most.\n ‚ñ∂¬† Pros and Cons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommand\nPros\nCons\n\n\n\n\nrebase\nClean, linear history; ideal for local branches\nIt‚Äôs possible that a ‚Äúcommit that was working fine‚Äù could turn into a ‚Äúcommit that doesn‚Äôt work.‚Äù\n\n\nmerge\nMaintains full history; safe for shared branches\nCreates new merge commits, making history less linear\n\n\n\nGenerally speaking,\n\ngit merge pull the latest changes from main into the feature branch, creating a new merge commit\ngit rebase changes the base of the feature branch to the latest commit and then replays the changes in the feature branch from there\n\n\n\n\nAt the branch development of Figure¬†1, you can rebase the feature branch with the following steps:\n# Step 1: Checkout the feature branch\ngit switch feature\n\n# Step 2: rebase onto main:\ngit rebase main\nThese commands tell Git to\n\nTemporarily remove B1, B2\nFast-forward the branch to main‚Äôs latest commit (A3, A4)\nApply B1, B2 on top of A4\n\nThen, git history will turn into the following\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%%{init: { 'logLevel': 'debug', 'theme': 'base', \n            'gitGraph': {'rotateCommitLabel': true,\n                         'mainBranchName': 'main'}}}%%\n    gitGraph\n       commit id: \"A1\"\n       commit id: \"A2\"\n       commit id: \"A3\"\n       commit id: \"A4\"\n       branch feature\n       commit id: \"B1\"\n       commit id: \"B2\"\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†2: Fig 2. git rebase\n\n\n\n\n\n ‚ñ∂¬† Conflicts caused by git rebase\nIf there are changes in main that modify the same parts of code as your commits, Git won‚Äôt know how to reconcile those differences automatically. These overlapping changes are what cause conflicts.\nFor example:\n\nLet‚Äôs say you edited file_A.py in your feature branch to add a new function.\nMeanwhile, another developer made a conflicting change to the same section of file_A.py in main.\n\nWhen rebase tries to apply your changes on top of main, Git encounters a conflict because it doesn‚Äôt know which version to keep. Instead, Git will list files with conflicts. You‚Äôll see a message like\nCONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in file_A.py\nOpen each conflicted file. Git will add conflict markers to show where the differences are:\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD\n// Code from main branch\n=======\n// Code from your feature branch\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; your-commit-hash\nYou are expected to decide which parts of the code to keep and remove the conflict markers (&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;, =======, &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;) after resolving. Then,\n# git add the modified files\ngit add file_A.py\n\n# Continue the rebase\ngit rebase --continue\nIf you want to start over or quit rebasing, you can abort the rebase with\ngit rebase --abort\n ‚ñ∂¬† ‚Äúcommit that was working fine‚Äù could turn into a ‚Äúnot working‚Äù\nWhen you rebase a branch, you‚Äôre reapplying commits onto a new base, which can potentially break previously functional code. So to minimize this risk, better to do the followings:\n\nTest after rebasing: After a rebase, test your feature branch to ensure that everything still works as expected.\nCheck each commit after conflicts: If you resolved conflicts during the rebase, double-check those areas to ensure the changes align with your intended functionality.\n\nIn summary, rebasing changes the context in which your commits operate, so it‚Äôs important to verify that they still work as intended in the new context."

However, a git clone --bare only copies the history, allowing for a quicker transfer to a new remote repository.\nAdditionally, you can create a non-bare repository from a bare repository. In most cases, when pushing, the new repository should be non-bareÔºé\nThe mirroring process is conducted through communication between the local and the new remote repository, so the old remote repository does not receive any notifications or updates of the new repository.\n\n\n\nWhy not no-bare git clone and git push ‚Äìmirror?\nWhen running git clone origin-url, you will get all of the tags copied, a local branch master (HEAD) tracking a remote branch origin/master, and remote branches origin/test1, origin/test2, and origin/test3.\nIf you do git push --mirror a non-bare cloned repository, it also pushes your remote branches, origin/test1, origin/test2, and origin/test3, because mirror implies everything. Then, you would get branches named origin/origin/test1."

    "section": "Solution",
    "text": "Solution\nThere are two ways to resolve this:\n\nRename your local branch to follow the naming convention, then push it to the remote.\nPush your current branch to the remote using the correct branch name without renaming it locally.\n\n\nSolution 1: rename your local branch name\n\nRenaming your local branch is explained on this post.\n ‚ñ∂¬† Commands\n# Step 1: rename your local branch\ngit branch -m &lt;old-name&gt; &lt;new-name&gt;\n\n# Step 2: push to the remote\ngit push -u origin HEAD\n\n\nSolution 2: Push a local git branch to a remote with a different name\n\ngit push origin local-branch-name:remote-branch-name tells Git to push the local branch local-branch-name to the remote repository origin and create/update the branch named remote-branch-name there.\nBut be aware the command carry some risks. If remote-branch-name already exists on the remote repository, this command will update it with the contents of your local branch. If others rely on the remote branch, your push might overwrite their changes, causing potential conflicts or loss of work.\nTo mitigate the above risk, it‚Äôs better to check the status of the remnote branch first with git fetch and git branch -a. DO NOT USE git push --force.\n ‚ñ∂¬† Commands\n# Step 1: git fetch and check your remote\ngit fetch \n\n# Step 2: Make sure your new remote name will not cause a problem\ngit branch -a  \n\n# Step 3: Push your local branch with different remote name\ngit push origin local-branch-name:remote-branch-name\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüçµ Green Tea Break: why use git fetch not git pull?\n\n\n\n ‚ñ∂¬† git fetch keeps your local work untouched\n\ngit fetch only downloads the updates from the remote repository without altering your working directory or merging these changes into your current branch.\ngit pull combines git fetch and git merge, fetching changes from the remote and immediately merging them into your current branch. This can cause conflicts if there are differences between your branch and the remote branch.\n\nIf you just want to fetch remote information to avoid naming conflicts and don‚Äôt intend to pull remote changes into your local branch, it‚Äôs better to use git fetch because it helps avoid unexpected merges."

For example, if there‚Äôs already a branch called feature/login on the remote, you might push you local feature/login branch as feature/login-update.\nIn this case, after pushing to the remote, make sure the upstream branch points to your intended branch. It‚Äôs a good idea to run\ngit branch -vvv\nand if the result is not what you expect, you can run\ngit branch --set-upstream-to=origin/new-feature\nto set your upstream branch to the correct one."
