Instead, Git will list files with conflicts. You’ll see a message like\nCONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in file_A.py\nOpen each conflicted file. Git will add conflict markers to show where the differences are:\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD\n// Code from main branch\n=======\n// Code from your feature branch\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; your-commit-hash\nYou are expected to decide which parts of the code to keep and remove the conflict markers (&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;, =======, &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;) after resolving. Then,\n# git add the modified files\ngit add file_A.py\n\n# Continue the rebase\ngit rebase --continue\nIf you want to start over or quit rebasing, you can abort the rebase with\ngit rebase --abort\n ▶  “commit that was working fine” could turn into a “not working”\nWhen you rebase a branch, you’re reapplying commits onto a new base, which can potentially break previously functional code. So to minimize this risk, better to do the followings:\n\nTest after rebasing: After a rebase, test your feature branch to ensure that everything still works as expected.\nCheck each commit after conflicts: If you resolved conflicts during the rebase, double-check those areas to ensure the changes align with your intended functionality.\n\nIn summary, rebasing changes the context in which your commits operate, so it’s important to verify that they still work as intended in the new context."

On the other hand, if you’re collaborating closely with others and want to ensure that history is preserved, or if you want to avoid rewriting shared commits, git merge is likely the better option.\n ▶  General Recommendation\n\nIf your feature branch is not shared yet, go with git rebase for a cleaner, linear history.\nIf your feature branch is already shared or part of a collaborative workflow, stick with git merge to avoid potential conflicts for collaborators.\n\n\nVersioning and git rebase strategy\nLet’s say you are working on a repository with the following versioning strategy:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVersion class\nexplained\n\n\n\n\nMajor Version (x)\nChanges in the major version indicate breaking changes or significant new features.\n\n\nMinor Version (y)\nChanges in the minor version often introduce new features that are backward-compatible.\n\n\nPatch Version (z)\nChanges in the patch version generally include bug fixes and minor improvements.\n\n\n\nThen, better to adopt the following git rebase strategy:\n ▶  Changes in x (Major Version):\n\nRecommendation: Always rebase.\nReason: Major changes may have significant impacts and require integration with the latest code. Rebasing helps ensure that the new major features align correctly with the current state of the codebase, avoiding integration issues.\n\n ▶  Changes in y (Minor Version):\n\nRecommendation: Rebase as a precaution.\nReason: While minor changes are generally backward-compatible, they can still introduce complexities. Rebasing hels ensuring the new minor features do not conflict with other updates.\n\n ▶  Changes in z (Patch Version):\n\nRecommendation: Rebase not required.\nReason: Patch changes are typically small fixes. If the changes in the main branch are minimal, there may be no need to rebase."

The setup syntax is\ngit config --global diff.tool your_preferred_tool\nFor example, if you prefer to vscode,\ngit config --global diff.tool vscode\nTo check if you successfully configure difftool editor,\ngit config -l\nthen, you can check what editor is you default git difftool editor.\n ▶  Choosing an editor temporarily\nIf you temporarily show the diff in vimdiff,\ngit difftool HEAD~1 HEAD --tool=vimdiff"

However, a git clone --bare only copies the history, allowing for a quicker transfer to a new remote repository.\nAdditionally, you can create a non-bare repository from a bare repository. In most cases, when pushing, the new repository should be non-bare．\nThe mirroring process is conducted through communication between the local and the new remote repository, so the old remote repository does not receive any notifications or updates of the new repository.\n\n\n\nWhy not no-bare git clone and git push –mirror?\nWhen running git clone origin-url, you will get all of the tags copied, a local branch master (HEAD) tracking a remote branch origin/master, and remote branches origin/test1, origin/test2, and origin/test3.\nIf you do git push --mirror a non-bare cloned repository, it also pushes your remote branches, origin/test1, origin/test2, and origin/test3, because mirror implies everything. Then, you would get branches named origin/origin/test1."

    "text": "Solution\nThere are two ways to resolve this:\n\nRename your local branch to follow the naming convention, then push it to the remote.\nPush your current branch to the remote using the correct branch name without renaming it locally.\n\n\nSolution 1: rename your local branch name\n\nRenaming your local branch is explained on this post.\n ▶  Commands\n# Step 1: rename your local branch\ngit branch -m &lt;old-name&gt; &lt;new-name&gt;\n\n# Step 2: push to the remote\ngit push -u origin HEAD\n\n\nSolution 2: Push a local git branch to a remote with a different name\n\ngit push origin local-branch-name:remote-branch-name tells Git to push the local branch local-branch-name to the remote repository origin and create/update the branch named remote-branch-name there.\nBut be aware the command carry some risks. If remote-branch-name already exists on the remote repository, this command will update it with the contents of your local branch. If others rely on the remote branch, your push might overwrite their changes, causing potential conflicts or loss of work.\nTo mitigate the above risk, it’s better to check the status of the remnote branch first with git fetch and git branch -a. DO NOT USE git push --force.\n ▶  Commands\n# Step 1: git fetch and check your remote\ngit fetch \n\n# Step 2: Make sure your new remote name will not cause a problem\ngit branch -a  \n\n# Step 3: Push your local branch with different remote name\ngit push origin local-branch-name:remote-branch-name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🍵 Green Tea Break: why use git fetch not git pull?\n\n\n\n ▶  git fetch keeps your local work untouched\n\ngit fetch only downloads the updates from the remote repository without altering your working directory or merging these changes into your current branch.\ngit pull combines git fetch and git merge, fetching changes from the remote and immediately merging them into your current branch. This can cause conflicts if there are differences between your branch and the remote branch.\n\nIf you just want to fetch remote information to avoid naming conflicts and don’t intend to pull remote changes into your local branch, it’s better to use git fetch because it helps avoid unexpected merges."

    "text": "Use-cases\n ▶  Temporarily Sharing Work\nIf you wants to share your work temporarily for a review or help, you might not want to overwrite an existing remote branch, so better to push your local branch with a temporary name, like temp/20241031-login-test.\n ▶  Avoid Naming Conflicts\nIf there is already a branch with the same name on the remote, you might want to push their local branch under a different name to avoid conflicts. For example, if there’s already a branch called feature/login on the remote, you might push you local feature/login branch as feature/login-update.\nIn this case, after pushing to the remote, make sure the upstream branch points to your intended branch. It’s a good idea to run\ngit branch -vvv\nand if the result is not what you expect, you can run\ngit branch --set-upstream-to=origin/new-feature\nto set your upstream branch to the correct one."
