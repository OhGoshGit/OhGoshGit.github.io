The script retrieves the list of configured Git remotes \n#   using the git remote command and stores it in the variable REMOTES.\n#   If no remotes are found, the script prints an error message and exits with a status code of 1.\n#--------------------------------------\n\n\n# Check if branch name is provided\nif [ -z \"$1\" ]; then\n  echo \"Usage: $0 &lt;branch-name&gt;\"\n  exit 1\nfi\n\n# Define the branch name\nBRANCH_NAME=$1\n\n# Get the list of remotes\nREMOTES=$(git remote)\n\n# Check if there are any remotes configured\nif [ -z \"$REMOTES\" ]; then\n  echo \"No remotes found. Please configure a remote repository.\"\n  exit 1\nfi\n\n# Push to each remote\necho \"$REMOTES\" | while read -r REMOTE; do\n    git push \"$REMOTE\" \"$BRANCH_NAME\"\ndone\n\nexit 0\nこのスクリプトを使用するには，以下の手順に従ってください：\n\nスクリプトをファイルに保存します（例：push_to_remotes.sh）\nスクリプトを実行可能にします：\n\nchmod +x push_to_remotes.sh\n\nブランチ名を引数として指定してスクリプトを実行します：\n\n```zsh ./push_to_remotes.sh"

    "text": "git rebase or git merge?\nAs explined above, if your goal is to maintain a clean and linear commit history and you’re working primarily with your own branches, git rebase is often the best choice. On the other hand, if you’re collaborating closely with others and want to ensure that history is preserved, or if you want to avoid rewriting shared commits, git merge is likely the better option.\n ▶  General Recommendation\n\nIf your feature branch is not shared yet, go with git rebase for a cleaner, linear history.\nIf your feature branch is already shared or part of a collaborative workflow, stick with git merge to avoid potential conflicts for collaborators.\n\n\nVersioning and git rebase strategy\nLet’s say you are working on a repository with the following versioning strategy:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVersion class\nexplained\n\n\n\n\nMajor Version (x)\nChanges in the major version indicate breaking changes or significant new features.\n\n\nMinor Version (y)\nChanges in the minor version often introduce new features that are backward-compatible.\n\n\nPatch Version (z)\nChanges in the patch version generally include bug fixes and minor improvements.\n\n\n\nThen, better to adopt the following git rebase strategy:\n ▶  Changes in x (Major Version):\n\nRecommendation: Always rebase.\nReason: Major changes may have significant impacts and require integration with the latest code. Rebasing helps ensure that the new major features align correctly with the current state of the codebase, avoiding integration issues.\n\n ▶  Changes in y (Minor Version):\n\nRecommendation: Rebase as a precaution.\nReason: While minor changes are generally backward-compatible, they can still introduce complexities. Rebasing hels ensuring the new minor features do not conflict with other updates.\n\n ▶  Changes in z (Patch Version):\n\nRecommendation: Rebase not required.\nReason: Patch changes are typically small fixes. If the changes in the main branch are minimal, there may be no need to rebase."

SSHキーをSSHエージェントに追加する\n\neval \"$(ssh-agent -s)\"\nssh-add ./.ssh/kirby_github_key\n\nssh-addコマンドは，プライベートSSHキーをSSH認証エージェント（ssh-agent）に追加し，SSH接続時にキーのパスフレーズを繰り返し要求されることなく使用できるようにします． キー（kirby_github_key）がssh-agentに追加されていない場合，SSHはそれを使用することができません．このようなエラーが発生する可能性があります：\nPermission denied (publickey).\n\n\n3. GitHubに公開キーを登録する\n\ncat ~/.ssh/kirby_github_key.pub\n\nファイルを開いた後，文字列をコピーしてGitHubのSettings &gt; SSH and GPG keys &gt; New SSH keyで登録します．\nその後，以下のコマンドで接続をテストします：\n\n\n4. SSH接続をテスト\n\n$ ssh -T git@github.com\n\n接続が正常に確立された場合，以下のようなメッセージが表示されます：\nEnter passphrase for key '/Users/hosinokkirby/.ssh/kirby_github_key': \nHi Kirby! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.\nSSHの設定ファイルを更新する\n毎回手動でssh-addを実行するのは面倒です．これを避けるため，~/.ssh/configファイルを編集してSSHが自動的にキーを使用するように設定できます：\n\n\n~/.ssh/config\n\nHost github github.com\n  HostName github.com\n  User git\n  Port 22\n  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/kirby_github_key\n  IdentitiesOnly yes\n  TCPKeepAlive yes"

    "text": "git rebase or git merge?\nAs explined above, if your goal is to maintain a clean and linear commit history and you’re working primarily with your own branches, git rebase is often the best choice. On the other hand, if you’re collaborating closely with others and want to ensure that history is preserved, or if you want to avoid rewriting shared commits, git merge is likely the better option.\n ▶  General Recommendation\n\nIf your feature branch is not shared yet, go with git rebase for a cleaner, linear history.\nIf your feature branch is already shared or part of a collaborative workflow, stick with git merge to avoid potential conflicts for collaborators.\n\n\nVersioning and git rebase strategy\nLet’s say you are working on a repository with the following versioning strategy:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVersion class\nexplained\n\n\n\n\nMajor Version (x)\nChanges in the major version indicate breaking changes or significant new features.\n\n\nMinor Version (y)\nChanges in the minor version often introduce new features that are backward-compatible.\n\n\nPatch Version (z)\nChanges in the patch version generally include bug fixes and minor improvements.\n\n\n\nThen, better to adopt the following git rebase strategy:\n ▶  Changes in x (Major Version):\n\nRecommendation: Always rebase.\nReason: Major changes may have significant impacts and require integration with the latest code. Rebasing helps ensure that the new major features align correctly with the current state of the codebase, avoiding integration issues.\n\n ▶  Changes in y (Minor Version):\n\nRecommendation: Rebase as a precaution.\nReason: While minor changes are generally backward-compatible, they can still introduce complexities. Rebasing hels ensuring the new minor features do not conflict with other updates.\n\n ▶  Changes in z (Patch Version):\n\nRecommendation: Rebase not required.\nReason: Patch changes are typically small fixes. If the changes in the main branch are minimal, there may be no need to rebase."

If you change your mind and want to unstage it (without losing your changes), you have two common options:\n\ngit restore --staged &lt;file&gt;\ngit reset &lt;file&gt;\n\nHere I will explain of the first one git restore, because it is part of the newer, task-specific Git commands. This command is more intuitive and descriptive, focusing only on the act of “restoring” the index state. It avoids the broader and potentially confusing implications of git reset, which can also affect commit history when used in other forms.\nTo unstage a specific file\ngit restore --staged &lt;file_name&gt;\nTo unstage multiple specific files\ngit restore --staged &lt;file_name1&gt; &lt;file_name2&gt; ...\n\nList all the files you want to unstage, separated by spaces.\n\nTo confirm the result after running\ngit status\n\n💻 custom alias setup for git unstage\nGit lets you define shortcuts (aliases) for longer commands via the [alias] section of .gitconfig.\nSetup Syntax\n[alias]\n    &lt;shortcut&gt; = &lt;actual git command&gt;\n\nDo not include git in the actual command — Git automatically prefixes it.\nYou may need quotes if the command includes spaces or options.\n\nAlias Setup\nThe following setup defines a Git subcommand alias called git unstage\n[alias]\n    unstage = \"restore --staged\"\nThen, git unstage &lt;file&gt; works the same as git restore --staged &lt;file_name&gt;"

If remote-branch-name already exists on the remote repository, this command will update it with the contents of your local branch. If others rely on the remote branch, your push might overwrite their changes, causing potential conflicts or loss of work.\nTo mitigate the above risk, it’s better to check the status of the remnote branch first with git fetch and git branch -a.

    "text": "Solution: git clone –bare\n ▶  Steps\n\nCreate a bare clone of the repository\nMirror-push to the new repository\nRemove the temporary old local repository\n\n ▶  Commands\n# Step 1\n% git clone --bare https://github.com/EXAMPLE-USER/LinearModels.git\n\n# Step 2\n% cd LinearModels.git\n% git push --mirror https://gitlab.econometrics.com/EXAMPLE-USER/NEW-REPOSITORY.git\n\n# Step 3\n% cd ..\n% rm -rf LinearModels.git\n\n📘 REMARKS \n\nA non-bare git clone downloads both the snapshot and history to the local machine. However, a git clone --bare only copies the history, allowing for a quicker transfer to a new remote repository.\nAdditionally, you can create a non-bare repository from a bare repository. In most cases, when pushing, the new repository should be non-bare．\nThe mirroring process is conducted through communication between the local and the new remote repository, so the old remote repository does not receive any notifications or updates of the new repository.\n\n\n\nWhy not no-bare git clone and git push –mirror?\nWhen running git clone origin-url, you will get all of the tags copied, a local branch master (HEAD) tracking a remote branch origin/master, and remote branches origin/test1, origin/test2, and origin/test3.\nIf you do git push --mirror a non-bare cloned repository, it also pushes your remote branches, origin/test1, origin/test2, and origin/test3, because mirror implies everything. Then, you would get branches named origin/origin/test1."
