However, a git clone --bare only copies the history, allowing for a quicker transfer to a new remote repository.\nAdditionally, you can create a non-bare repository from a bare repository. In most cases, when pushing, the new repository should be non-bareÔºé\nThe mirroring process is conducted through communication between the local and the new remote repository, so the old remote repository does not receive any notifications or updates of the new repository.\n\n\n\nWhy not no-bare git clone and git push ‚Äìmirror?\nWhen running git clone origin-url, you will get all of the tags copied, a local branch master (HEAD) tracking a remote branch origin/master, and remote branches origin/test1, origin/test2, and origin/test3.\nIf you do git push --mirror a non-bare cloned repository, it also pushes your remote branches, origin/test1, origin/test2, and origin/test3, because mirror implies everything.

    "text": "Solution\nThere are two ways to resolve this:\n\nRename your local branch to follow the naming convention, then push it to the remote.\nPush your current branch to the remote using the correct branch name without renaming it locally.\n\n\nSolution 1: rename your local branch name\n\nRenaming your local branch is explained on this post.\n ‚ñ∂¬† Commands\n# Step 1: rename your local branch\ngit branch -m &lt;old-name&gt; &lt;new-name&gt;\n\n# Step 2: push to the remote\ngit push -u origin HEAD\n\n\nSolution 2: Push a local git branch to a remote with a different name\n\ngit push origin local-branch-name:remote-branch-name tells Git to push the local branch local-branch-name to the remote repository origin and create/update the branch named remote-branch-name there.\nBut be aware the command carry some risks. If remote-branch-name already exists on the remote repository, this command will update it with the contents of your local branch. If others rely on the remote branch, your push might overwrite their changes, causing potential conflicts or loss of work.\nTo mitigate the above risk, it‚Äôs better to check the status of the remnote branch first with git fetch and git branch -a. DO NOT USE git push --force.\n ‚ñ∂¬† Commands\n# Step 1: git fetch and check your remote\ngit fetch \n\n# Step 2: Make sure your new remote name will not cause a problem\ngit branch -a  \n\n# Step 3: Push your local branch with different remote name\ngit push origin local-branch-name:remote-branch-name\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüçµ Green Tea Break: why use git fetch not git pull?\n\n\n\n ‚ñ∂¬† git fetch keeps your local work untouched\n\ngit fetch only downloads the updates from the remote repository without altering your working directory or merging these changes into your current branch.\ngit pull combines git fetch and git merge, fetching changes from the remote and immediately merging them into your current branch. This can cause conflicts if there are differences between your branch and the remote branch.\n\nIf you just want to fetch remote information to avoid naming conflicts and don‚Äôt intend to pull remote changes into your local branch, it‚Äôs better to use git fetch because it helps avoid unexpected merges."

    "text": "Use-cases\n ‚ñ∂¬† Temporarily Sharing Work\nIf you wants to share your work temporarily for a review or help, you might not want to overwrite an existing remote branch, so better to push your local branch with a temporary name, like temp/20241031-login-test.\n ‚ñ∂¬† Avoid Naming Conflicts\nIf there is already a branch with the same name on the remote, you might want to push their local branch under a different name to avoid conflicts. For example, if there‚Äôs already a branch called feature/login on the remote, you might push you local feature/login branch as feature/login-update.\nIn this case, after pushing to the remote, make sure the upstream branch points to your intended branch. It‚Äôs a good idea to run\ngit branch -vvv\nand if the result is not what you expect, you can run\ngit branch --set-upstream-to=origin/new-feature\nto set your upstream branch to the correct one."
